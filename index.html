The students do this for special days like parent appreciation day or the last day of school. In higher grades, kids use things like recorders and sing songs taught by the music teacher.

                    <p>The students of 5th grade found out that there is a debate on whether Chocolate Milk was going to be removed or not. Their writing teacher took this as an opportunity for them to write an opinion argument essay. He let them use the internet to search if the amount of sugar in the drink was worth the share of nutrients in the chocolate milk. The students learned a lot by writing their essay and the principal saw every single on of them.</p>

School days were shorter, Recess options were limited to decrease risk of spread. However, that didn't stop the school from having fun! Classes would get more PE, at the end of the year, there is going to be a massive water balloon party with people dropping water balloons on kids from drones, water balloon canons! There is also going to be a bingo where everyone can win prizes as big as bikes!

                <p id="a" class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">After a month of learning school on zoom, the students were able to go back to in-person school. However, there were many changes. The education gap was cut because of the short days. There were 2 groups, AM and PM. While AM started school at 8, the PM were doing online school. And when the AM group was dismissed, an hour later the PM would come to school and the AM would start online school all for slowing the spread. Masks had to be worn at all times, except if you are outside and 6 feet away from any student or teacher.
